Here lie Rudy's scripts for the Advent of Code 2021.

## Beware of Spoilers

Don't look here if you're not done yet. Seriously!

## Running the Challenges

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is required to run these solutions.

Puzzles can be run with the following command:

```bash
# Run all challenges
make run

# Just install the expected node (not necessary)
make setup-node
```
